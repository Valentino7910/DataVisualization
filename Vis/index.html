    <h1>Statistics on COVID deaths in OECD countries</h1>
    <p>The bar chart visualizes the latest data on all-cause deaths, excess mortality, and COVID-19 deaths across
      OECD countries, organized by week. Each bar represents a specific week, with the height of the bar
      indicating the number of deaths recorded during that period. The chart provides insights into the temporal
      patterns of mortality rates, highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall mortality and
      excess deaths compared to typical trends. By examining the variations in bar heights over time and comparing
      across countries, viewers can gain a deeper understanding of the pandemic's toll on public health and
      mortality rates across different regions.</p>
